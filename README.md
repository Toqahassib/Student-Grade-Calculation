# Python Student Grades Calculation System


In this project, I designed a grading system for a multiple modules using object oriented programming (OOP) in python. The purpose of the program is to provide users with the ability to enter modules’ data and students’ data in each semester. It gives the user options to calculate and display the average score of the entire class for a specific assessment per module in a semester, the average score for the module in a semester, and the total score and academic performance for each student per module in a semester. It also provides the user with options to sort the output based on their selection. In addition, it can find and display the maximum/minimum score for a specific assessment per module in a semester, the maximum/minimum score for the module in a semester.  

The program was precisely designed by optimal use of data types and data structures, proper use of control statements, efficient modular design using classes, methods, functions, correct use of specialized algorithms, and coherent flow sequence. The report aims to provide detailed analysis of the resulting grading system. It shows how the grading system was conducted.
